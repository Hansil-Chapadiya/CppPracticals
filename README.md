# C++ Practice Project

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs and exercises that I am using to practice and improve my C++ programming skills. The programs range from simple console applications to more complex algorithms and data structures.

## Features

- **Basic Syntax:** Programs that demonstrate the fundamentals of C++ syntax, including variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
- **Functions:** Examples of function definitions, overloading, recursion, and inline functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Exercises covering classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms:** Practice with sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), and other algorithmic problems.
- **File Handling:** Programs demonstrating reading from and writing to files.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Use of C++ STL features like vectors, maps, sets, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the programs in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Common options include:

- **GCC**: Available on Linux and MacOS.
- **MinGW**: A popular choice for Windows users.
- **Visual Studio**: Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE) that includes a C++ compiler.

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hansil-Chapadiya/CppPracticals.git
    cd cpp-practice
    ```

2. Compile and run any of the programs. For example:

    ```bash
    g++ basics/hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
    ./hello_world
    ```

    Or with Visual Studio:

    - Open the project in Visual Studio.
    - Build and run the desired program using the IDE.
